<h2>Introduction</h2>

Parse_trans was written in order to capture some useful patterns in parse transformation
and code generation for Erlang.

Most notably, perhaps, the module {@link exprecs} generates standardized accessor
functions for records, and {@link ct_expand} makes it possible to evaluate an
expression at compile-time and substitute the result as a compile-time constant.

Less known modules, perhaps:
* {@link parse_trans_pp} can be called with escript to pretty-print source from
  debug-compiled .beam files.
* {@link parse_trans_codegen} provides pseudo-functions that can be used for
  simple code generation.
* {@link parse_trans} provides various helper functions for traversing code and
  managing complex parse transforms
